			<p class="par"><span class="sp1">More Access To Information: </span> In today's society, Internet connections are nearly as common as televisions and 
			telephones and it has replaced both of those standard items in some households. Unbelievable amounts of information, both good and bad, are now 
			accessible through home computers that have made learning about any subject much easier.</p>
			
			<p class="par"><span class="sp1">Research At Your Fingertips: </span> Writing a research paper or looking up information for a school 
			project no longer requires a trip to the library. Periodicals and newspapers have gone online in many cases and some research 
			information is available exclusively online. The speed at which students can locate reliable research has improved the understanding of 
			many subjects and undoubtedly makes the quality of learning better in many cases. </p>
			
			<p class="par"><span class="sp1">Increased Computer Literacy: </span> Simply using the computer to surf the Internet, regardless of the 
			purpose, has made computer literacy among young people become a standard ability. The Internet lures people from early in life and makes
			the aware of the correct way to use a computer at a much earlier age than just one generation before.</p>
			
			<p class="par"><span class="sp1">Lower Cost Education </span> The abundance of online education on virtual campuses has led to some reduced
			cost option in education, making higher learning more accessible to people with limited budgets. It no longer requires tuition, fees, 
			and room and board to get a college degree. The less expensive tuition of online schools as well as the absence of the need for commuting or
			paying for campus living has given more people the opportunity to learn.</p>
			
			<p class="par"><span class="sp1">The Latest Information: </span> Instead the constant updating of editions of textbooks and reference 
			material, the Internet provides the latest information in a fraction of the time and expense of the previous methods. A simple 
			update of a website can convey all the changes necessary to those using the site for educational purposes.</p>
			<p class="par"><span class="sp1">Accessible 24/7: </span> For the above education system of Computer we can
